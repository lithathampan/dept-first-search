/************************************************************************************************
*
*  The class GraphMaker has a static method makeGraph that reads data on a weighted 
*   directed graph from a file and creates a graph object.  The file must be organized
*   as follows:
*
*  The first line contains the number of vertices in the graph.  The vertices will
*   be numbered from 0 to numberOfVertices-1.
*  The remaining lines contain data on directed edges.  Each line will have a 
*   beginning and ending vertex index (integers from 0 to numberOfVertices-1) 
*   and the weight of the edge (a double value).
*  The method does not check for errors in the file.
